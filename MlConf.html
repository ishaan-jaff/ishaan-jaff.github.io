 <h4>Globally, wearable devices have had a significant impact on our lives primarily due to their fitness monitoring and other-health related metrics. However, the accuracy and correctness will play a major role in their popularity and adoption rate. The wearable devices market is expected to exceed more than USD $51.0 Billion by 2022, and ensuring that these devices can accurately measure their user’s health metrics is of immense relevance. One of the major challenges in the process of measuring a user’s metrics is activity recognition. This paper proposes and implements an applied machine learning approach to classify a user’s activity as: sitting, sitting down, standing, standing up, walking. A dataset(165,663 instances) with data collected from 4 subjects wearing accelerometers placed on their waist, left thigh, right arm and right ankle is used. The classifier model is built using the J48 decision tree machine learning algorithm</h4>
